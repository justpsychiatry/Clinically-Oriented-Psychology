after which she lost her memories of the last three months. She can
remember the events that happened later but not the other events that
happened prior to it or during it, strictly for three months before the

alcohol and benzodiazepines in the past and such incidents happened in
the past as well, however, she recalled the events later. On

<li>A 24-year-old medical student was rushed by ambulance to the
emergency department after an accident on his motorcycle. On
examination, he had shown evidence of head injury. The attendant stated
that he lost consciousness for a very short time. After a week in the
intensive care unit, the patient's condition changed. You talked to him,
but he does not remember what happened and why he is in hospital. The

<li>A 45-year-old man presented with memory problems along with social
and occupational impairment. He had difficulty with learning new
information and making appropriate plans. He retained the ability to
perform daily activities but during the interview, he was observed to
give a vivid and detailed but wholly fictitious account of recent
activities, which the patient believes to be true. On mental status
examination older memories being better preserved, emotional blunting
and inertia were observed. Lack of insight into his condition All these
symptoms precipitated after a suicide attempt with vehicle exhaustion.
Digit span test is typically normal. He was noted to respond immediately
to firmly set limits and rewards, but deficits in memory prevented
long-term incorporation of these boundaries. New learning is grossly
defective. And hence concluded amnestic disorder. Which area typically
produce "purest" amnesia.
