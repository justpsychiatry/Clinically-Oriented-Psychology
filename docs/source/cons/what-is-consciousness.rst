   By the end of this section, you will be able to: 

   * Understand what is meant by consciousness
   * Explain how circadian rhythms are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, and how circadian cycles can be disrupted
   * Discuss the concept of sleep debt

:term:`Consciousness` describes our awareness of
internal and external stimuli. Awareness of internal stimuli includes
feeling pain, hunger, thirst, sleepiness, and being aware of our
thoughts and emotions. Awareness of external stimuli includes seeing the
light from the sun, feeling the warmth of a room, and hearing the voice
of a friend.

We experience different states of consciousness and different levels of
awareness on a regular basis. We might even describe consciousness as a
continuum that ranges from full awareness to deep sleep. 
:term:`Sleep` is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical
activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of
rest that occur during wakefulness. :term:`Wakefulness` is characterized by 
high levels of sensory awareness, thought, and behavior. 
In between these extremes are states of
consciousness related to daydreaming, intoxication as a result of
alcohol or other drug use, meditative states, hypnotic states, and
altered states of consciousness following sleep deprivation. We might
also experience unconscious states of being via drug-induced anesthesia
for medical purposes. Often, we are not completely aware of our
surroundings, even when we are fully awake. For instance, have you ever
daydreamed while driving home from work or school without really
thinking about the drive itself? You were capable of engaging in the all
of the complex tasks involved with operating a motor vehicle even though
you were not aware of doing so. Many of these processes, like much of
psychological behavior, are rooted in our biology. 

.. admonition:: Coma, Stupor, and Clouding of Consciousness 
   :class: tip

   Coma, stupor, and clouding of consciousness are three clinically
   relevant, abnormality of consciousness. 

   **Clouding of consciousness**, the hallmark of delirium, refers to a spectrum of 
   reduced consciousness ranging from subtle impairment to complete stupor. **Stupor** 
   occurs when the affected individual appears unconscious, but can still respond 
   to painful stimuli. **Coma** occurs when there is a total loss of consciousness. A person 
   in a state of coma does not respond to environmental stimuli.  


BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS
==================

:term:`Biological rhythms` are internal rhythms of
biological activity. A woman’s menstrual cycle is an example of a
biological rhythm—a recurring, cyclical pattern of bodily changes. One
complete menstrual cycle takes about 28 days—a lunar month—but many
biological cycles are much shorter. For example, body temperature
fluctuates cyclically over a 24-hour period
(`[link] <#Figure_04_01_Rhythms>`__). Alertness is associated with
higher body temperatures, and sleepiness with lower body temperatures.

   :align: center

   A line graph is titled “Circadian Change in Body Temperature (Source:
   Waterhouse et al., 2012).” 
   
   The y-axis, is labeled “temperature (degrees
   Fahrenheit),” ranges from 97.2 to 99.3. The x-axis, which is labeled
   “time,” begins at 12:00 A.M. and ends at 4:00 A.M. the following day.
   The subjects slept from 12:00 A.M. until 8:00 A.M. during which time
   their average body temperatures dropped from around 98.8 degrees at
   midnight to 97.6 degrees at 4:00 A.M. and then gradually rose back to
   nearly the same starting temperature by 8:00 A.M. The average body
   temperature fluctuated slightly throughout the day with an upward tilt,
   until the next sleep cycle where the temperature again dropped.


This pattern of temperature fluctuation, which repeats every day, is one
example of a circadian rhythm. A :term:`circadian rhythm` 
is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period
of about 24 hours. Our sleep-wake cycle, which is linked to our
environment’s natural light-dark cycle, is perhaps the most obvious
example of a circadian rhythm, but we also have daily fluctuations in
heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and body temperature. Some
circadian rhythms play a role in changes in our state of consciousness.

If we have biological rhythms, then is there some sort of :term:`biological clock`? 
In the brain, the hypothalamus, which lies superior to the pituitary gland, 
is a main center of homeostasis. :term:`Homeostasis` is the tendency to
maintain a balance, or optimal level, within a biological system.

The brain’s clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus
known as the :term:`suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)`.
The axons of light-sensitive neurons in the retina provide information
to the SCN based on the amount of light present, allowing this internal
clock to be synchronized with the outside world (Klein, Moore, &
Reppert, 1991; Welsh, Takahashi, & Kay, 2010)
(`[link] <#Figure_04_01_SCN>`__).

PROBLEMS WITH CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS
===============================

Generally, and for most people, our circadian cycles are aligned with
the outside world. For example, most people sleep during the night and
are awake during the day. One important regulator of sleep-wake cycles
is the hormone :term:`melatonin`. The :term:`pineal gland`, 
an endocrine structure located inside the
brain that releases melatonin, is thought to be involved in the
regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during
sleep (Hardeland, Pandi-Perumal, & Cardinali, 2006). Melatonin release
is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light.

.. admonition::
   :class: warning

   Use of electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers at night
   inhibits melatonin release 

There are individual differences with regards to our sleep-wake cycle.
For instance, some people would say they are morning people, while
others would consider themselves to be night owls. These individual
differences in circadian patterns of activity are known as a person’s
**chronotype**, and research demonstrates that morning larks and night owls
differ in sleep regulation. :footcite:p:`taillardCircadianHomeostaticModulation2003`  
:term:`Sleep regulation` refers to the brain’s control of switching between sleep 
and wakefulness as well as coordinating this cycle with the outside world.

Disruptions of Normal Sleep
---------------------------

Whether lark, owl, or somewhere in between, there are situations in
which a person’s circadian clock gets out of synchrony with the external
environment. One way that this happens involves traveling across
multiple time zones. When we do this, we often experience jet lag. 
:term:`Jet lag` is a collection of symptoms that results
from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our
environment. These symptoms include fatigue, sluggishness, irritability,
and :term:`insomnia` (i.e., a consistent difficulty in
falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week for over a months
month’s time) (Roth, 2007).

Individuals who do rotating shift work are also likely to experience
disruptions in circadian cycles. :term:`Rotating shift work` refers
to a work schedule that changes from early to
late on a daily or weekly basis. For example, a person may work from
7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Monday, 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday,
and 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday. In such instances, the
individual’s schedule changes so frequently that it becomes difficult
for a normal circadian rhythm to be maintained. This often results in
sleeping problems, and it can lead to signs of depression and anxiety.
These kinds of schedules are common for individuals working in health
care professions and service industries, and they are associated with
persistent feelings of exhaustion and agitation that can make someone
more prone to making mistakes on the job (Gold et al., 1992; Presser,
1995).

Rotating shift work has pervasive effects on the lives and experiences
of individuals engaged in that kind of work, which is clearly
illustrated in stories reported in a qualitative study that researched
the experiences of middle-aged nurses who worked rotating shifts (West,
Boughton & Byrnes, 2009). Several of the nurses interviewed commented
that their work schedules affected their relationships with their
family. One of the nurses said,

   If you’ve had a partner who does work regular job 9 to 5 office hours
   . . . the ability to spend time, good time with them when you’re not
   feeling absolutely exhausted . . . that would be one of the problems
   that I’ve encountered. (West et al., 2009, p. 114)

While disruptions in circadian rhythms can have negative consequences,
there are things we can do to help us realign our biological clocks with
the external environment. Some of these approaches, such as using a
bright light as shown in `[link] <#Figure_04_01_BrightLight>`__, have
been shown to alleviate some of the problems experienced by individuals
suffering from jet lag or from the consequences of rotating shift work.
Because the biological clock is driven by light, exposure to bright
light during working shifts and dark exposure when not working can help
combat insomnia and symptoms of anxiety and depression (Huang, Tsai,
Chen, & Hsu, 2013).

Insufficient Sleep
------------------

When people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the
demands of day-to-day life, they accumulate a sleep debt. A person with
a :term:`sleep debt` does not get sufficient sleep on
a chronic basis. The consequences of sleep debt include decreased levels
of alertness and mental efficiency. Interestingly, since the advent of
electric light, the amount of sleep that people get has declined. While
we certainly welcome the convenience of having the darkness lit up, we
also suffer the consequences of reduced amounts of sleep because we are
more active during the nighttime hours than our ancestors were. As a
result, many of us sleep less than 7–8 hours a night and accrue a sleep
debt. While there is tremendous variation in any given individual’s
sleep needs, the National Sleep Foundation (n.d.) cites research to
estimate that newborns require the most sleep (between 12 and 18 hours a
night) and that this amount declines to just 7–9 hours by the time we
are adults.

If you lie down to take a nap and fall asleep very easily, chances are
you may have sleep debt. Given that college students are notorious for
suffering from significant sleep debt (Hicks, Fernandez, & Pelligrini,
2001; Hicks, Johnson, & Pelligrini, 1992; Miller, Shattuck, & Matsangas,
2010), chances are you and your classmates deal with sleep debt-related
issues on a regular basis. In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation
updated their sleep duration hours, to better accommodate individual
differences. `[link] <#Table_04_01_01>`__ shows the new recommendations,
which describe sleep durations that are “recommended”, “may be
appropriate”, and “not recommended”.

Sleep debt and sleep deprivation have significant negative psychological
and physiological consequences `[link] <#Figure_04_01_Sleepless>`__. As
mentioned earlier, lack of sleep can result in decreased mental
alertness and cognitive function. In addition, sleep deprivation often
results in depression-like symptoms. These effects can occur as a
function of accumulated sleep debt or in response to more acute periods
of sleep deprivation. It may surprise you to know that sleep deprivation
is associated with obesity, increased blood pressure, increased levels
of stress hormones, and reduced immune functioning (Banks & Dinges,
2007). A sleep deprived individual generally will fall asleep more
quickly than if she were not sleep deprived. Some sleep-deprived
individuals have difficulty staying awake when they stop moving (example
sitting and watching television or driving a car). That is why
individuals suffering from sleep deprivation can also put themselves and
others at risk when they put themselves behind the wheel of a car or
work with dangerous machinery. Some research suggests that sleep
deprivation affects cognitive and motor function as much as, if not more
than, alcohol intoxication (Williamson & Feyer, 2000).

   To assess your own sleeping habits, read this
   `article <http://openstax.org/l/sleephabits>`__ about sleep needs.

The amount of sleep we get varies across the lifespan. When we are very
young, we spend up to 16 hours a day sleeping. As we grow older, we
sleep less. In fact, a :term:`meta-analysis`, which is
a study that combines the results of many related studies, conducted
within the last decade indicates that by the time we are 65 years old,
we average fewer than 7 hours of sleep per 
day :footcite:p:`ohayonMetaAnalysisQuantitativeSleep2004`. 
As the amount of time we sleep varies
over our lifespan, presumably the sleep debt would adjust accordingly.

Summary
=======

States of consciousness vary over the course of the day and throughout
our lives. Important factors in these changes are the biological
rhythms, and, more specifically, the circadian rhythms generated by the
**suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)**. Typically, our biological clocks are
aligned with our external environment, and light tends to be an
important cue in setting this clock. When people travel across multiple
time zones or work rotating shifts, they can experience disruptions of
their circadian cycles that can lead to insomnia, sleepiness, and
decreased alertness. Bright light therapy has shown to be promising in
dealing with circadian disruptions. If people go extended periods of
time without sleep, they will accrue a sleep debt and potentially
experience a number of adverse psychological and physiological
consequences.

Critical Thinking Questions
===========================

.. card::

   .. card::

      Healthcare professionals often work rotating shifts. Why is this
      problematic? What can be done to deal with potential problems?

   .. dropdown::

      Given that rotating shift work can lead to exhaustion and
      decreased mental efficiency, individuals working under these
      conditions are more likely to make mistakes on the job. The
      implications for this in the health care professions are obvious.
      Those in health care professions could be educated about the
      benefits of light-dark exposure to help alleviate such problems.

.. card::

   .. card::

      Generally, humans are considered diurnal which means we are awake
      during the day and asleep during the night. Many rodents, on the
      other hand, are nocturnal. Why do you think different animals have
      such different sleep-wake cycles?

   .. dropdown::

      Different species have different evolutionary histories, and they
      have adapted to their environments in different ways. There are a
      number of different possible explanations as to why a given
      species is diurnal or nocturnal. Perhaps humans would be most
      vulnerable to threats during the evening hours when light levels
      are low. Therefore, it might make sense to be in shelter during
      this time. Rodents, on the other hand, are faced with a number of
      predatory threats, so perhaps being active at night minimizes the
      risk from predators such as birds that use their visual senses to
      locate prey.

Personal Application Questions
==============================

.. card::

   .. card::

      We experience shifts in our circadian clocks in the fall and
      spring of each year with time changes associated with daylight
      saving time. Is springing ahead or falling back easier for you to
      adjust to, and why do you think that is?

   .. card::

      What do you do to adjust to the differences in your daily schedule
      throughout the week? Are you running a sleep debt when daylight
      saving time begins or ends?
